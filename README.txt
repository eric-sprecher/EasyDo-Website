Uses a combination of Node js and Express js for the CRUD server and mongoose to read from and add to the mongodb database where user information and todo items are stored.

To run, ensure that the dependencies are downloaded and, while in the "backend" folder, run "node index" to start.

This should run the site on localhost:3000.

Thanks!
